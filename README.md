# Traffic-Light-with-Pedestrian-Crossing
Traffic Light System with Pedestrian Crossing using Arduino Uno, LEDs, a push button and a mini breadboard.

Good evening to everyone,
It's my first repository. In this, I've created a Traffic Signal with Pedestrian Crossing facility.
1. Traffic LEDs: Red, Yellow, and Green
2. Pedestrian LED: Blue
3. Push Button: Allows pedestrians to request crossing
4. Arduino Uno Board & a Mini Breadboard

In normal condition signal is going to run as usual - (Red for 2sec, Yellow for 2sec and then Green for 6sec).
But when someone press the button then, it's going to switch on pedestrian mode and both Red & Blue LEDs will glow simultaneously for 4sec, and again after that it would be in its normal condition untill someone press the button.
